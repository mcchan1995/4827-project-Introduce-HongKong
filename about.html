				<h3>Hong Kong background</h3>
				<p><img src="assets/images/about.jpg" alt="" class="img-rounded pull-right" width="300" > Hong Kong originally belonged to the territory of Guangdong in southern China. Before Hong Kong opened as a port, the cultural center in southern China was Guangzhou. Therefore, Hong Kong culture is in the same vein as Lingnan culture in Guangzhou and other places, for example, Cantonese is used as the main language. Before becoming a British colony, Weitou people, Hakka people and people from the water have all settled in Hong Kong today.

Among them, the Waitou and Shuiren dialects spoken by Waitou and Shuiren belong to the branch of Cantonese. After Hong Kong became a British colony, Western culture began to be introduced into Hong Kong. In the following hundred years, Chinese and Western cultures continued to develop in Hong Kong, and they influenced and merged with each other, gradually forming a Hong Kong culture combining Chinese and Western cultures. Many Chinese folk customs, such as the parade of colors, the Taiping Qing ceremonies, and the Yu Lan Festival, have developed uninterruptedly in the Chinese society. Herbal tea, Cantonese opera, and the culture of drinking morning tea are also very prosperous. Western cultures such as horse racing and football have gradually become popular in Chinese society.

A mix of Chinese dishes (such as Cantonese and Hakka dishes) and Western food, plus multi-national dishes can be found in Hong Kong, so it is known as a "food paradise". Among them, tea restaurants and big pai stalls are the representatives of authentic food culture.</p>
